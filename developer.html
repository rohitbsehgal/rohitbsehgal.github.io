<span>Software Developer</span>
<p>
Rohit Sehgal is interested in facets of the software development process. In short, Rohit "makes" software for the world to use. His work includes researching, designing, implementing, and testing software. Rohit also takes part in design, programming, and project management. He contributes to the overview of the project on the application level rather than component-level or individual programming tasks. He is often still guided by lead programmers but the description also is a freelance software developer.

<span>Web Designer</span>
<p>
Rohit Sehgal encompasses many different skills and disciplines in the production and maintenance of websites. The different areas of web design he has worked in include web graphic design; interface design; authoring, including standardised code and proprietary software; user experience design; and search engine optimization. Often Rohit will work in teams covering different aspects of the design process, although sometimes he will cover them all. The term web design is normally used to describe the design process relating to the front-end (client side) design of a website including writing mark up. Web design partially overlaps web engineering in the broader scope of web development. Rohit also has an awareness of usability.

<span>User Interface Design</span>
<p>
User interface design (UID) or user interface engineering is the design of user interfaces for machines and software, such as computers, home appliances, mobile devices, and other electronic devices, with the focus on maximizing the user experience. The goal of user interface design is to make the user's interaction as simple and efficient as possible, in terms of accomplishing user goals (user-centered design).

Good user interface design facilitates finishing the task at hand without drawing unnecessary attention to itself. Graphic design and typography are utilized to support its usability, influencing how the user performs certain interactions and improving the aesthetic appeal of the design; design aesthetics may enhance or detract from the ability of users to use the functions of the interface. The design process must balance technical functionality and visual elements (e.g., mental model) to create a system that is not only operational but also usable and adaptable to changing user needs.

Interface design is involved in a wide range of projects from computer systems, to cars, to commercial planes; all of these projects involve much of the same basic human interactions yet also require some unique skills and knowledge. As a result, designers tend to specialize in certain types of projects and have skills centered on their expertise, whether that be software design, user research, web design, or industrial design.</p>

<p>
User experience design (UXD or UED) is the process of enhancing user satisfaction by improving the usability, ease of use, and pleasure provided in the interaction between the user and the product. User experience design encompasses traditional humanâ€“computer interaction (HCI) design, and extends it by addressing all aspects of a product or service as perceived by users.
</p>
<span>Graphic Design</span>
<p>
Graphic design is the methodology of visual communication, and problem-solving through the use of type, space and image. The field is considered a subset of visual communication and communication design, but sometimes the term "graphic design" is used interchangeably with these due to overlapping skills involved. Graphic designers use various methods to create and combine words, symbols, and images to create a visual representation of ideas and messages. A graphic designer may use a combination of typography, visual arts and page layout techniques to produce a final result. Graphic design often refers to both the process (designing) by which the communication is created and the products (designs) which are generated.

Common uses of graphic design include identity (logos and branding), publications (magazines, newspapers and books), print advertisements, posters, billboards, website graphics and elements, signs and product packaging. For example, a product package might include a logo or other artwork, organized text and pure design elements such as images, shapes and color which unify the piece. Composition is one of the most important features of graphic design, especially when using pre-existing materials or diverse elements.
